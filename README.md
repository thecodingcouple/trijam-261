# trijam-261
Source code for our Trijam 261 entry. The theme is "One Wrong Move."

[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-261) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours of development time. We went over the 3 hour goal and spent about 8 hours of active development time in creating the artwork and programming the game.

Try out it out [here](https://thecodingcouple.github.io/trijam-261/)!

## Synopsis

In **Famous Blunders** you are replaying the final moments before a chess player blundered a game piece. The objective of the game is to identify which piece was blundered and where it was moved to. To play the game, players will:

1. Select a square with the game piece to move
2. Select a destination square for the game piece
